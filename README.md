Project Overview

This repository contains documentation, configuration, and code required to implement an end-to-end Smart Student Enrollment & Learning Portal on the Salesforce platform. The solution automates lead capture, admission processing, course selection, batch allocation, fee tracking, notifications, and reporting for educational institutes.

Key components:

Salesforce declarative configuration (Objects, Flows, Process Builder, Permission Sets)

Apex classes and triggers for complex business logic

Lightning Web Components (LWC) for modern UI

Integration connectors (REST / SOAP / Middleware)

CI/CD scripts (SFDX / GitHub Actions)

Data migration scripts and sample datasets

Goals & Success Criteria

Reduce manual admission processing time by X% (set target).

Improve data accuracy for student records and fee tracking.

Provide user-friendly agent and admin UX using Lightning.

Achieve zero-critical-bugs at Go-Live and <2 per month after stabilization.

Deliver full documentation and handover for admins and IT.

High-level Architecture

Front-end UI: Lightning Experience (LWC) for students/admins, Experience Cloud site for external users.

Salesforce Orgs: Dev → CI → UAT → Production.

Data: Custom objects for Lead, Student__c, Course__c, Batch__c, Enrollment__c, Payment__c.

Integrations: Payment gateway, SMS/Email provider, ERP (finance) via secure REST endpoints or middleware (MuleSoft/Boomi).

CI/CD: SFDX + GitHub Actions (or Jenkins) for automated validation and deploys.

Monitoring: Salesforce Health Check, Event Monitoring, and custom error logging.

Project Phases & Process (End-to-End)

This section is a playbook you can follow for any Salesforce implementation.

Phase 0 — Initiation

Stakeholder identification & RACI.

High-level scope & budget.

Success metrics (KPIs) and governance model.

Create project workspace (repo, Jira/Asana, Confluence).

Phase 1 — Discovery & Requirement Gathering

Workshops: Admission officers, teachers, students, finance, IT.

Phase 3 — Development & Configuration

Configure Salesforce declaratively: Objects, fields, page layouts, validation rules, flows.

Implement Apex and LWC for advanced behavior.

Build Experience Cloud site (if required).

Setup external services & named credentials.

Best practices:

Use unlocked packages or metadata API with SFDX.

Keep logic testable and bulkified.

Keep triggers minimal — use handler patterns.

Phase 4 — Integration & Data Migration

Extract, transform, and load historical data.

Implement middleware or direct integrations.

Staging loads and data reconciliation.

Deliverables: Data migration scripts, test loads, reconciliation report.

Phase 5 — Testing

Unit tests: Apex with >75% coverage and positive + negative cases.

Integration tests.

UAT with stakeholders using real scenarios.

Performance & security testing.

Deliverables: Test plan, test cases, UAT sign-off.

Phase 6 — Training & Documentation

Admin and end-user training sessions (recordings + docs).

Provide runbooks and FAQs.

Knowledge transfer to internal Salesforce admins.

Phase 7 — Deployment & Go-Live

Freeze changes, final data migration cutover.

Execute release plan and smoke tests.

Support window post-launch for rapid fixes.

Phase 8 — Post-Go-Live Support & Continuous Improvement

Stabilization period with a dedicated triage team.

Collect feedback and plan iterative enhancements.

Maintenance schedule for releases and org cleanups.

Salesforce Org Strategy & Environments

Dev: personal scratch orgs and shared dev sandboxes.

CI / Integration: automated validation sandbox or pool sandbox.

UAT: full-copy or partial-copy sandbox for business UAT.

Performance: optional full-copy sandbox.

Production: final environment; deploy via validated CI/CD pipeline.

Data Model & Key Objects

Minimal set of objects for enrollment solution:

Lead (standard) — inbound inquiries.

Student__c (custom) — consolidated student record.

Course__c (custom) — course catalog.

Batch__c (custom) — scheduled batch info.

Enrollment__c (custom) — join between Student & Batch.

Payment__c (custom) — fee payments, status, receipts.

Admission_Process__c (custom) — track application stages.

Include the important fields, sample picklists (status, payment mode), and validation rules. Keep field-level security and page layouts aligned with personas.

Features & User Stories (Examples)

As an admission officer, I want to convert a lead to a student record so I can track enrollments.

As a student, I want to pay fees online and receive a receipt via email/SMS.

As a finance admin, I want to export monthly receipts and reconcile payments with ERP.

As a teacher, I want to view batch rosters and attendance.

Configuration Details
Declarative components

Flows: lead capture -> auto-assign to counsellor -> convert to Student__c and Enrollment__c.

Process Builder/Flow Scheduler: for scheduled actions (prefer Flow).

Validation Rules: ensure required fields and data integrity.

Permission Sets & Profiles: read/write controls.

Page Layouts & Record Types: for different institute types / courses.

Reports & Dashboards: enrollment funnel, fees due, batch occupancy.

Sample Flow design

Trigger: On Lead creation via Web-to-Lead or API.

Steps: validate data → assign owner → create tasks for counselor → if accepted, create Student__c + Enrollment__c.

Custom Code (Apex, LWC, Triggers)
Apex Guidelines

Use trigger frameworks (one trigger per object).

Bulkify and minimize SOQL/DML.

Implement meaningful unit tests, cover positive/negative and edge cases.

Abstract business logic into service classes.

Example Apex Trigger Pattern (skeleton)
trigger LeadTrigger on Lead (after insert, after update) {
    if (Trigger.isAfter) {
        LeadTriggerHandler.handleAfter(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap);
    }
}

Example Apex Handler (skeleton)
public with sharing class LeadTriggerHandler {
    public static void handleAfter(List<Lead> newLeads, Map<Id, Lead> oldMap){
        // validation, conversion, callouts, etc.
    }
}

LWC / Lightning

Use LWC for modern interactive components (enrollment wizard, payment UI).

Keep security: use @AuraEnabled Apex for server operations and enforce sharing.

Integrations

Payment Gateway: REST-based with Named Credentials and Auth. Use secure callback handling for payment confirmations.

SMS/Email: Use external providers (Twilio, SendGrid) or Salesforce Email services.

ERP / Finance: Middleware-based integration (batch exports or near real-time sync).

Authentication: SSO (SAML/OAuth) for staff; Communities for external users.

Best practices:

Use Named Credentials and Named Principal when possible.

Log all integration errors and retry with exponential backoff.

Secure credentials via protected Custom Metadata or Secrets Manager.

Data Migration & ETL

Extract sample from legacy systems (CSV/DB dumps).

Clean & transform in staging (remove duplicates, normalize fields).

Use Data Loader CLI, SFDX data commands, or ETL tools (Talend, Informatica).

Validate and reconcile counts and sample records.

Steps:

Map legacy fields to Salesforce schema.

Load master data (Course__c, Batch__c).

Load Student__c with external IDs.

Load Enrollment__c and Payment__c referencing external IDs.

CI / CD & Deployment

Tooling: SFDX (Salesforce CLI), Git, GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

Recommended flow:

Developers push feature branches.

Pull request triggers automated SFDX validation (run tests).

Merge to main triggers package creation and UAT deployment.

After UAT sign-off, deploy to Production with a validated deployment.

Metadata Management: Use source:push/source:pull for scratch orgs and source:convert + mdapi for sandbox/prod where needed.

Release windows: schedule off-business-hours, prepare rollback plan.

Sample GitHub Action snippet (skeleton)
name: Validate & Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install sfdx
        uses: amtrack/sfdx-action@v1
      - run: sfdx force:auth:jwt:grant ... # auth to CI org
      - run: sfdx force:source:deploy -x manifest/package.xml -c
      - run: sfdx force:apex:test:run --resultformat human --wait 10

Testing Strategy

Unit tests for all Apex classes (include negative paths).

Integration tests for APIs (use Postman/Newman or automated tests).

UAT with business users — checklist-driven.

Regression tests on every release; automate where possible.

Performance testing for heavy data operations.

User Training & Handover

Create role-based training materials: Admin guide, End-user quickstart, Troubleshooting.

Conduct live sessions and record them.

Provide runbooks: how to add new courses, reconcile payments, troubleshoot failed integrations.

Monitoring, Maintenance & Backups

Monitoring: Health Check, scheduled reports for errors & failed callouts, Apex exception logging (custom object).

Backups: Regular exports (weekly/monthly) via Data Export or third-party backup apps.

Maintenance: Quarterly org cleanup, field usage reports, inactive user clean-up.

Ownership: Assign a Salesforce admin and an escalation path for incidents.

Security & Compliance

Use IP restrictions & 2FA for admin users.

Enforce least privilege via Permission Sets and Profiles.

Protect PII: field-level encryption if required, secure storage of sensitive data.

Audit & compliance: enable Setup Audit Trail and Field History Tracking where needed.

Ensure GDPR/PCI considerations for payment and personal data.

Troubleshooting & Rollback Plan

Pre-deploy: validate in a sandbox and run full test suite.

Deploy checklist: data backups, change freeze, rollback plan.

Rollback strategies:

If configuration-only: re-deploy previous metadata from Git tag.

If data migrations applied: keep pre-migration snapshots to restore.

For quick fixes: hotfix branch -> test -> patch deploy.

Error logging: centralize errors in a Platform_Error__c object for faster triage.
