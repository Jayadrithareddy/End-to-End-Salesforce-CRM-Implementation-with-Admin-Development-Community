## Project Overview

A complete, production-ready **Salesforce** implementation for the **Smart Student Enrollment & Learning Portal**: automated lead capture, admissions processing, course selection, batch allocation, fee management, notifications, analytics, and integrations with payment/ERP systems.

This README is designed for GitHubâ€”copy it to the repository root as `README.md`.

---

## Goals & Success Criteria

* Reduce manual admission processing time by **X%** (replace X with target).
* Reliable fee collection with online payment reconciliation.
* 0 critical bugs at Go-Live; < 2 critical issues/month after stabilization.
* Dashboard visibility for leadership (enrollment funnel, revenue, batch occupancy).

---

## High-level Architecture

* **UI:** Lightning Experience + Lightning Web Components (LWC) + Experience Cloud site for applicants.
* **Data:** Salesforce core objects + custom objects (`Student__c`, `Course__c`, `Batch__c`, `Enrollment__c`, `Payment__c`).
* **Integrations:** Payment gateway, SMS/Email, ERP/Finance via secure REST/Middleware.
* **CI/CD:** SFDX + GitHub Actions for automated validations & deploys.

## Project Phases & Process (End-to-End)

Follow this checklist as a project playbook. Each *Deliverable* should live in `/docs/` in the repo.

### Phase 0 â€” Initiation

* Stakeholder list & RACI.
* Project charter & KPIs.
* Repo, issue tracker, and collaboration workspace setup.

### Phase 1 â€” Discovery & Requirement Gathering

* Conduct workshops with Admission, Finance, Faculty, Students.
* Map user journeys & acceptance criteria.
* Deliverables: BRD, Process Maps, User Stories.

### Phase 2 â€” Solution Design

* Data model + API contracts.
* UI wireframes (LWC pages).
* Security & permission model.
* Deliverables: SDD, ER diagrams, Permission Matrix.

### Phase 3 â€” Development & Configuration

* Declarative: Objects, Flows, Validation Rules, Reports, Dashboards.
* Programmatic: Apex services, Trigger handlers, LWC components.
* Use Scratch Orgs and unlocked packages for modularity.

### Phase 4 â€” Integration & Data Migration

* ETL plan, sample transforms, and reconciliation reports.
* Integration designs: payment callbacks, ERP sync schedules.

### Phase 5 â€” Testing

* Unit tests (Apex), integration tests (Postman/Newman), UAT scenarios.
* Performance and security testing.

### Phase 6 â€” Training & Handover

* Admin documentation, runbooks, recorded sessions.
* Handover checklist: access, backups, support contacts.

### Phase 7 â€” Deployment & Go-Live

* Freeze, final migration, validated deployment, smoke tests.
* Post-go-live hyper-care window.

### Phase 8 â€” Maintenance

* Quarterly cleanups, backup verification, iterative enhancements.

---

## Org Strategy & Environments

* **Dev:** Scratch orgs & developer sandboxes.
* **CI/Integration:** Persistent sandbox for automated tests.
* **UAT:** Partial/full-copy sandbox for business validation.
* **Perf (optional):** Full-copy sandbox for scalability tests.
* **Prod:** Lockdown releases via CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Data Model & Key Objects

**Core objects:** Lead (standard), `Student__c`, `Course__c`, `Batch__c`, `Enrollment__c`, `Payment__c`, `Admission_Process__c`.

**Design notes:**

* Use External IDs for migration reconciliation.
* Keep normalization: Course catalog as master data, Batch references Course, Enrollment relates Student & Batch.

---

## Features & User Stories (Examples)

* **Admission Officer:** Convert lead â†’ student â†’ enrollment.
* **Student:** Apply online, make payment, view status.
* **Finance:** Reconcile payments, export receipts to ERP.
* **Teacher:** View class roster & attendance.

---

## Configuration & Implementation Details

### Declarative

* Flows to automate lead assignment & conversion.
* Permission sets & profiles for role-based access.
* Reports: Enrollment funnel, Fee collection, Batch utilization.

### Recommended Flow Example (abstract)

1. Web-to-Lead â†’ Lead created.
2. Validation Flow verifies required fields.
3. Assignment rules
